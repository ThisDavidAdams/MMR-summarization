Republicans currently hold 29 governorships, Democrats have 20, and Rhode Island's Lincoln Chafee is an Independent, NPR reports. Eight of the gubernatorial seats up for grabs are now held by Democrats; three are in Republican hands. Polls and race analysts suggest that only three of tonight's races are considered competitive, all in states where incumbent Democratic governors aren't running again: Montana, New Hampshire, and Washington. While those state races remain too close to call, Republicans are expected to wrest the North Carolina governorship from Democratic control, and to easily win GOP-held seats in Utah, North Dakota, and Indiana. Democrats are likely to hold on to their seats in West Virginia and Missouri, and are expected to notch safe wins in races for seats they hold in Vermont and Delaware. Holding Sway On Health Care While the occupant of the governor's office is historically far less important than the party that controls the state legislature, top state officials in coming years are expected to wield significant influence in at least one major area. \"No matter who wins Eight of the gubernatorial seats up for grabs are now held by Democrats; three are in Republican hands.

Here's a look at some of the bigger ones: Abortion: The court could rule as soon as next month on whether states can regulate abortion clinics, the New York Times reports. A lower court had already struck down a key part of California's law, but a ruling in favor of the state could open the door to similar laws in other states. Immigration: The court could rule on President Obama's right to grant work permits to millions of immigrants who entered the US illegally as children, Politico reports. But it's unclear whether that fight will get to the justices in time for a decision this term or whether Obama's effort to expand his executive actions on immigration will remain blocked by a lower court order until the president leaves office. Affirmative action: The court could rule on the constitutionality of Texas' affirmative action program, which uses race as a factor in college admissions. The last time the case came before the court, Anthony Kennedy voted with the other six justices to declare the program unconstitutional, but he's not expected to do the same this time around.

If it is indeed the home of the legendary watering hole, the discovery could mean that the building that is perhaps Manhattan's oldest is slated to demolished. “After the English had marched up the Bowery and out of the city (in 1783), George Washington and Governor (George) Clinton stopped at the Bull’s Head (tavern),” preservationist Adam Woodward told WCBS 880’s Alex Silverman. Legend had it that “the Bull’s Head’s structure, cellar, bones” were still inside, Woodward said. He decided to poke around and, in the basement, Woodward found what he believes are Colonial-era, hand-hewn, and hand-planed joists and foundation walls. “Found myself in what I am pretty certain is the 1750s historic tavern,” he said. Woodward said he felt compelled to investigate in the building, which once housed a chain drugstore and the Atlantic Garden beer garden, because time was running out. “I just realized that it would be the last chance to solve one of the great mysteries of New York Preservationist Adam Woodward believes he has found evidence that a Manhattan building is the former site of an 18th-century tavern.\n","MMR Length: 9\n","PEGASUS Length: 8\n","Iteration written to output.\n","\n","\n","Iteration: 7\n","Mallet LDA: 5 topics, 3 topic bits, 111 topic mask\n","Data loaded.\n","max tokens: 27\n","total tokens: 505\n","\n","Total time: 0 seconds\n","Your max_length is set to 300, but you input_length is only 110.

Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn filed papers Thursday to forfeit the century-old cubist painting, which was reported missing from a Pompidou storeroom in 2001, the AP reports. \"A lost treasure has been found,\" US Attorney Loretta Lynch said in a statement. The 1911 cubist painting \"La Coiffeuse,\" which translates to \"The Hairdresser,\" was bequeathed to France's National Museum and was placed in storage at the Centre Georges Pompidou, where staffers discovered it was missing when they received a loan request for it. It was shipped by Federal Express from Belgium in December and seized at the Port of Newark. Officials said the shipper was identified only as \"Robert\" and the destination was a climate-controlled storage facility in Queens. Court papers did not indicate whether the sender or intended recipient have been identified. French museum officials came to New York last month to examine the painting in person alongside historical records and photographs, and they confirmed that it was \"La Coiffeuse.\" Under federal law, imported merchandise can be seized by the government if it was stolen or smuggled.

Republicans currently hold 29 governorships, Democrats have 20, and Rhode Island's Lincoln Chafee is an Independent, NPR reports. Eight of the gubernatorial seats up for grabs are now held by Democrats; three are in Republican hands. Republicans currently hold 29 governorships, Democrats have 20, and Rhode Island's Chafee is an Independent. Polls and race analysts suggest that only three of tonight's races are considered competitive, all in states where incumbent Democratic governors aren't running again: Montana, New Hampshire, and Washington. While those state races remain too close to call, Republicans are expected to wrest the North Carolina governorship from Democratic control, and to easily win GOP-held seats in Utah, North Dakota, and Indiana. Democrats are likely to hold on to their seats in West Virginia and Missouri, and are expected to notch safe wins in races for seats they hold in Vermont and Delaware. Holding Sway On Health Care While the occupant of the governor's office is historically far less important than the party that controls the state legislature, top state officials in coming years are expected to wield significant influence in at least one major area. \"No matter who wins Voters in 11 states will pick their governors tonight.\n","MMR Length: 10\n","PEGASUS Length: 9\n","Iteration written to output.\n","\n","Ind_number: 2\n","Iteration: 2\n","Mallet LDA: 5 topics, 3 topic bits, 111 topic mask\n","Data loaded.\n","max tokens: 34\n","total tokens: 276\n","\n","Total time: 0 seconds\n","MMR Output: The page used a photo of two men kissing to promote the event. – Facebook removed a photo of two men kissing in protest of a London pub's decision to kick a gay couple out, prompting scores of people to post their own photos of same-sex couples kissing in protest, the New York Times reports. \"The photo in question does not violate our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities and was removed in error,\" a Facebook rep says. \"We apologize for the inconvenience.\" The Facebook page was set up to promote a \"gay kiss-in\" demonstration in London to protest the pub.

Eight of the gubernatorial seats up for grabs are now held by Democrats; three are in Republican hands. Republicans currently hold 29 governorships, Democrats have 20, and Rhode Island's Chafee is an Independent. Polls and race analysts suggest that only three of tonight's races are considered competitive, all in states where incumbent Democratic governors aren't running again: Montana, New Hampshire, and Washington. While those state races remain too close to call, Republicans are expected to wrest the North Carolina governorship from Democratic control, and to easily win GOP-held seats in Utah, North Dakota, and Indiana. Democrats are likely to hold on to their seats in West Virginia and Missouri, and are expected to notch safe wins in races for seats they hold in Vermont and Delaware.

Not only does the deal give Microsoft access to Nokia's patents, but it gives Microsoft a real shot in the arm as it looks to take on Apple and Google in the smartphone market. \"The Nokia acquisition will instantly make Microsoft the world's No. 1 smartphone company,\" Winkler writes. \"It also gives Microsoft a real shot in the arm as it looks to take on Apple and Google in the tablet market.\" The deal is good news for Microsoft, but it's also bad news for Nokia, writes David Pogue at the New York Times. The acquisition will make Microsoft an even bigger player in the tablet market, but it will also make Microsoft an even bigger competitor in the smartphone market. \"The only way Microsoft is going to win is if it Microsoft is buying Nokia's cell phone business and licensing its patent portfolio.\n","MMR Length: 11\n","PEGASUS Length: 10\n","Iteration written to output.\n","\n","\n","Iteration: 5\n","Mallet LDA: 5 topics, 3 topic bits, 111 topic mask\n","Data loaded.\n","max tokens: 38\n","total tokens: 1424\n","\n","Total time: 0 seconds\n","Your max_length is set to 300, but you input_length is only 108.

Here's a look at some of the bigger ones: Abortion: The court could rule as soon as next month on whether states can regulate abortion clinics, the New York Times reports. A lower court had already struck down a key part of California's law, but a ruling in favor of the state could open the door to similar laws in other states. Immigration: The court could rule on President Obama's right to grant work permits to millions of immigrants who entered the US illegally as children, Politico reports. But it's unclear whether that fight will get to the justices in time for a decision this term or whether Obama's effort to expand his executive actions on immigration will remain blocked by a lower court order until the president leaves office. Affirmative action: The court could rule on the constitutionality of Texas' affirmative action program, which uses race as a factor in college admissions. The last time the case came before the court, Anthony Kennedy voted with the other six justices to declare the program unconstitutional, but he's not expected to do the same this time around. Public sector unions: The court could In the weeks ahead, the court is set to hear arguments over the constitutionality of capital sentences.\n","MMR Length: 9\n","PEGASUS Length: 8\n","Iteration written to output.\n","\n","\n","Iteration: 6\n","Mallet LDA: 5 topics, 3 topic bits, 111 topic mask\n","Data loaded.\n","max tokens: 35\n","total tokens: 573\n","\n","Total time: 0 seconds\n","Your max_length is set to 300, but you input_length is only 125.

If it is indeed the home of the legendary watering hole, the discovery could mean that the building that is perhaps Manhattan's oldest is slated to demolished. “After the English had marched up the Bowery and out of the city (in 1783), George Washington and Governor (George) Clinton stopped at the Bull’s Head (tavern),” preservationist Adam Woodward told WCBS 880’s Alex Silverman. Legend had it that “the Bull’s Head’s structure, cellar, bones” were still inside, Woodward said. He decided to poke around and, in the basement, Woodward found what he believes are Colonial-era, hand-hewn, and hand-planed joists and foundation walls. “Found myself in what I am pretty certain is the 1750s historic tavern,” he said. Woodward said he felt compelled to investigate in the building, which once housed a chain drugstore and the Atlantic Garden beer garden, because time was running out. “I just realized that it would be the last chance to solve one of the great mysteries of New York Preservationist Adam Woodward believes he has found evidence that a Manhattan building is the former site of an 18th-century tavern.\n","MMR Length: 9\n","PEGASUS Length: 8\n","Iteration written to output.\n","\n","\n","Iteration: 7\n","Mallet LDA: 5 topics, 3 topic bits, 111 topic mask\n","Data loaded.\n","max tokens: 27\n","total tokens: 505\n","\n","Total time: 0 seconds\n","Your max_length is set to 300, but you input_length is only 110.

Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn filed papers Thursday to forfeit the century-old cubist painting, which was reported missing from a Pompidou storeroom in 2001, the AP reports. \"A lost treasure has been found,\" US Attorney Loretta Lynch said in a statement. The 1911 cubist painting \"La Coiffeuse,\" which translates to \"The Hairdresser,\" was bequeathed to France's National Museum and was placed in storage at the Centre Georges Pompidou, where staffers discovered it was missing when they received a loan request for it. It was shipped by Federal Express from Belgium in December and seized at the Port of Newark. Officials said the shipper was identified only as \"Robert\" and the destination was a climate-controlled storage facility in Queens. Court papers did not indicate whether the sender or intended recipient have been identified. French museum officials came to New York last month to examine the painting in person alongside historical records and photographs, and they confirmed that it was \"La Coiffeuse.\" Under federal law, imported merchandise can be seized by the government if it was stolen or smuggled. \"The market to The canvas had been smuggled out of a storeroom of the Centre Georges Pompidou.\n","MMR Length: 11\n","PEGASUS Length: 10\n","Iteration written to output.\n","\n","\n","Iteration: 9\n","Mallet LDA: 5 topics, 3 topic bits, 111 topic mask\n","Data loaded.\n","max tokens: 21\n","total tokens: 108\n","\n","Total time: 0 seconds\n","Your max_length is set to 300, but you input_length is only 135.
