# MMR-summarization

In addition to the libraries in the requirements.txt file, our approach uses Mallet, which should be downloaded to a mallet-2.0.8 folder accessible to the code, and a MALLET_HOME path variable should be set on your system.

Additionally, use "python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm" to download spacy for loading in the LDA computation.

MMR_Filter.py contains the code to perform the MMR calculations
